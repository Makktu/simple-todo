# Simple ToDo

Another side-project to test everything learned so far. I think I can accomplish this without having to look anything up. This project is to test that.

Project goals:

-   a simple interface to

1. Create new to-do entries
2. View entries in an ordered list (pre-customised to show by Date to begin with)
3. Mark entries as done
4. Delete entries
5. Show a list of done entries
6. Show a list of deleted entries
